Keeping inventory about tenants and clusters. It's the "database" for the link:https://github.com/projectsyn/lieutenant-api[lieutenant-api]. It primarily holds information about the tenants and clusters.

It also handles the management of some requirements like Git repositories and secret management: it can automatically populate Git repositories with skeleton files when a new cluster is added. It will also generate a token to be used by link:https://github.com/projectsyn/steward[Steward].
