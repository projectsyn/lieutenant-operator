==== Operator Common

The first iteration is a single Operator consisting of several
controllers, sharing CR Go structs as the objects depend on each other.
A later iteration could split these controllers into their own Operator
if it makes sense then. The Operator will be implemented using the
https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/[operator-sdk] in Go.
