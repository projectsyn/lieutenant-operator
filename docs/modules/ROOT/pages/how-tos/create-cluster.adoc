kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: c-ae3os1
  namespace: lieutenant
  annotations:
    syn.tools/protected-delete: "false"
spec:
  displayName: Another Big Corp. Production Cluster
  deletionPolicy: Delete
  gitRepoTemplate:
    path: cluster
    repoName: cluster2
    deletionPolicy: Delete
    apiSecretRef:
      name: lieutenant-secret
      namespace: lieutenant
    deployKeys:
      test:
        type: ssh-ed25519
        key: AAAACxxxx
        writeAccess: true
  tenantRef:
    name: t-aezoo6
  tokenLifeTime: 4h
  facts:
    distribution: openshift3
    cloud: cloudscale
