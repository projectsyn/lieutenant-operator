= Connection to GitLab

For the Lieutenant Operator to be able to connect to the GitLab API, the following configuration needs to be made.

== Get GitLab Token

Visit the GitLab instance you'd like to use. Login with the user that has the permissions necessary to write to the group you want to store your Project Syn repositories.

Visit `\https://yourgitlab/profile/personal_access_tokens` and create a token with the following settings:

== Add Secret with Endpoint Information

Before any other things can be created we need to specify the git endpoints first.

[source,yaml]
....
apiVersion: v1
stringData:
  endpoint: http://10.144.1.197:8080
  token: Bvi1s19qp25Wt-rtGfMy
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: lieutenant-secret
  namespace: syn-lieutenant
type: Opaque
....

Save the file as `secret.yaml` and then apply it with `kubectl apply -f secret.yaml`.
