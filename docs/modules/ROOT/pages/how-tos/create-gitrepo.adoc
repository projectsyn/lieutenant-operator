= Create a Git Repository

It's usually not necessary to create a Git Repository manually, as they're automatically created through a cluster or tenant. But if you need an operator managed git repository you can do that with the following manifest.

The following example manifest will create a Git Repository:

[source,yaml]
....
apiVersion: syn.tools/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepo
metadata:
  name: example-gitrepo2
  namespace: lieutenant
spec:
  tenantRef:
    name: foo
    namespace: lieutenant
  apiSecretRef:
    name: lieutenant-secret
  path: cluster/subgroup
  repoName: bar
  deployKeys:
    test:
      type: ssh-ed25519
      key: AAAACxxxx
      writeAccess: true
      writeAccess: false
....

Please be aware that you first need to have a valid secret containing the endpoint information, see xref:how-tos/gitlab-connection.adoc[Connection to GitLab].
