= Repository Adoption

Repository Adoption is the process of managing Git repositories that weren't created by Lieutenant.

By default if you create a `GitRepo` resource that references a Git repository that already exits, Lieutenant will not adopt and manage it.
This should prevent accidental modification of existing repositories and also avoids issues if two `GitRepo` resources reference the same repository.

Adoption can be enabled per `GitRepo` by setting `spec.creationPolicy` to `Adopt` or as a global default by setting `DEFAULT_CREATION_POLICY` to `Adopt`.
Enabling adoption can be helpful for migrations or disaster recovery.
